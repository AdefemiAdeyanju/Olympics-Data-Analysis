# Olympics-Data-Analysis
A comprehensive Analysis on 1922 - 2016 Winter and Summer Olympics using python

This project was undertaken to analyze the various outcomes of the 1922 - 2016 olympics games.

## Project Steps

### Step 1 - Data Collection

*I downloaded the dataset from kaggle.
*I imported the dataset into the program using the pandas read_csv built-in function.


### Step2 - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

*I inspected the shape of the dataset.

*I derived basic information from the above collected data using the .describe(), .info(), and .head() methods.

*I checked for the presence of null values in the dataset.

*I inspected the total number of null values in the dataset.

*I extracted all columns present with null values to a list.

*I wrote a query to extract the participants of Nigeria's data from the dataset.

*I wrote a query to extract the participants of Ghana's data from the dataset.

*I inpected the top 10 countries who have participated in the olympics.

*I extracted all games done during the Winter Sports Olympics.

*I extracted all games done during the Summer Sports Olympics.

*I inspected the total number of athletes based on gender.

*I inspected the total number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won.

*I inspected the total number of male participants in each olympic year.

*I inspected the total number of female participants in each olympic year.

*I inspected the total number of gold medalists over 60 years based on ID.

*I inspected the total number of gold medalists over 60 years based on sports.

*I inspected the total number of gold, silver, and bronze medals won.

*I inspected the most gold medalists based on Teams.

*I inspected the countries with most amount of gold medals in the 2016 Rio Olympics.

*I filtered notnull values from the dataset.

### Step3 - Data Visualization

*I visualized the Country Overall Participation in form of a bar chart.

*I plotted a histogram to visualise the Age Distribution in the dataset.

*I plotted a pie chart to visualize the Gender Distribution.

*I visualized the total number of men that participated in each year of the summer olympics with a bar chart.

*I plotted a line chart to visualize the number of male athletes over time.

*I visualized the total number of women that participated in each year of the summer olympics with a bar chart.

*I plotted a line chart to visualize the number of female athletes over time.

*I visualized all gold medalists from the dataset.

*I visualized the events of gold athletes over 60 years of age.

*I inspected the top 5 countries with total amount of gold medalists.

*I plotted a bar chat to visualize the medals of countries for the year 2016.

*I plotted the Height vs Weight of Olympic Medalists using a Scatterplot.
